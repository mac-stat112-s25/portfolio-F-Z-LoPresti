title: "Bivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
#Importing data
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv") 
```

```{r}
#Downloading tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#Create bivariate visualization!
ggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "purple", "red"))+
  labs( y = "Density of Votes", 
        x = "Percentage of Republican Votes", 
        fill = "Historical County Type", 
        title = "Comparative Density of Republican Percentages by Historical County Types")
```
