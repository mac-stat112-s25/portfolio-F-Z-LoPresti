Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Import data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))
```

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, 
                    x = temp9am, 
                    color = location, 
                    shape = raintoday)) + 
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap (~location) +
  labs (x = "Morning Temperatures (F)", 
        y = "Afternoon Temperatures (F)", 
        color = "Location", 
        shape = "Recorded Rain", 
        title = "Morning vs Afternoon Temperatures by Location and Presence of Rain")
