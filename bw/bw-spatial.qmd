```{r}
# Import starbucks location data
fave_places <- read.csv("https://ajohns24.github.io/data/112/our_fave_places.csv")
```

```{r}
# A simple but effective leaflet map!
leaflet(data = fave_places) |>
  addProviderTiles("USGS") |>
  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex("purple")) |>
  addPolylines(
    lng = ~longitude,
    lat = ~latitude,
    color = col2hex("pink")
  )
